# Overview
•	Created an interactive web page with AJAX technology (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) for users to explore events, update personal preference, and get recommendation events.  
•	Developed a web service based on Apache Tomcat (Java servlet with RESTful API) to handle HTTP requests and get data from TicketMaster.  
•	Built relational database (MySQL) to store user data for consistency and NoSQL database (MongoDB) for scaling.  
•	Designed a content-based recommendation algorithm based on favorite categories.  
•	Improved the precision of the algorithm through ordering events by distance and categories.  
•	Deployed the server to Amazon EC2 and tested the web service with unit tests (JUnit) and load tests (Apache JMeter), which is 150 QPS.
